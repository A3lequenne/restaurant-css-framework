# Indian restaurant using Tailwindcss
Website for a fake franchise of restaurants.<br>
[My Indian restaurants website](https://A3lequenne.github.io/restaurant-css-framework)
## Welcome
Homepage of the website. Also used to show promotions and events.
## Menu
Simple menu of our proposed dishes at the restaurant. <br>
## Gallery
Gallery of a few pictures of the "restaurant" <br>
## About us
A simple page where the history of the restaurant and the available locations are shown.
## Contact
Contact form used to send messages to the restaurant. A few message subjects can be chosen.
## Possible improvements
I'm not satisfied by the overall style of the website. I had a few problems setting up the work environment (vite + tailwindcss) and I've had problems to deploy the website (one day to setup, more than one day to deploy). I would have liked to be able to work more on the website, but I'm happy to have used tailwindcss and vite.

Some possible improvements :
- Add privacy/EU legal cookies popup.
- Make a better gallery page (I had something way better with JS but i couldnt manage to "npm build" the pictures that were called in the JS script)
- More dishes options
- I could do a better navbar
- Add more informations about the restaurants
- Add a footer

I'm waiting for your feedbacks.
